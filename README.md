# Solana GIF Portal Project

connectiing our blockchain through phantom solana wallet
we will be reading and writing datas into the solana blockchain.  
 Without backend database or Api, the stateless solana blockchain is able to store our data which in this project is a link to a gif and displayed in our react client.

All that is needed is a phantom wallet for authentication and you can easily write into the solana blockchain, datas will be read instantly on our client.
