A solana phantom wallet is needed to interract with this smart contract
 
connect your Phantom wallet and save your favourite gifs in the meterverse. the gif is 100% owned by you and saved to the solana blockchain 

 Without backend, database or Api, the stateless solana blockchain is able to store  data which in this project is a link to a gif and displayed in  the react client.

All that is needed is a phantom wallet for authentication and you can easily write into the solana blockchain, datas will be read instantly on the client.
